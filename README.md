# Saul Rotter For TruMedia

This project was bootstrapped in React, with react-bootstrap for some styling. 

Website: https://saul-rotter.github.io/react_app

## What you'll find
Using the data provided from the trumedia API, I focused on the NFL QBs. With this site you can view stats for the 2018 season for any of the 3 qbs provided in the data.

On visit to the player page you can see
1. A base player card with picture, team, and some season long statistics
2. A table that includes all the stats from each game ordered by the week.
3. Or a graph charting the players completion% and yds/att for each week.

## Next
These are the next steps for this project if this was going to be launched to production.

1. UI Polish: everything works but to be presentable to an end user the UI needs to be cleaned up with improved spacing and features
2. Adding Typing for the objects being passed around. This will help avoid errors and improve readability as well.
3. Player Comparisons
4. More in depth look at each player
